# NoJunk
A Chrome extension to remove ads/comments/hot network questions/autoreplay from StackOverflow and Youtube

Iâ€™ve been meaning to write this for a while now - an extension that strips StackOverflow of all the junk banner content from/for other StackExchange sites, its jobs forum, and more. Bundled in was added functionality to remove the comments section of Youtube (nothing too intellectual going on there), and disable the AutoReplay feature that was recently added. A project that was motivated mostly by personal preferences and intended for personal use, but releasing it in case anyone else has the same small annoyances as me visiting these sites.

You can browse through the source here or download the the **`.crx`** extension file [here](http://people.csail.mit.edu/skoppula/files/nojunk/NoJunk.crx).

### A small show-and-tell
YouTube without the addon:

YouTube with the addon (comments removed, AutoReplay disabled, and switch removed)

I often reference StackOverflow, but side content, most notably *Hot Network Questions*, have had a tendency to suck me in from what I'm doing with their rather interesting but picayune questions. NoJunk strips every StackOverflow answer of *HotNetworkQuestions* and a few other top bar, footer, and banner material, to make a cleaner Q-A page.

Hope you try it out and find it useful. I don't promise next-day support, but I'll try to fix any bugs filed on Github. Pull-requests welcome.
